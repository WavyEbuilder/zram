# Automatic zram setup

I made this script since there are no init independent zram-related scripts and/or programs so I'll be making one for everyone to use

## Compatibility

It will run on any POSIX-Compliant shell, init system, coreutilities (Tested on chimerautils)

## Dependencies

Right now, it only needs `cat`, `grep` and `bc`
